**T1D Daily Simulator**
Same tasks. Different toll.

A simulation of what it feels like to _live_ with Type 1 Diabetes.
The tasks stay the same — but the energy doesn’t.
You start the day with half the fuel. The system breaks before the day ends.

What it shows
- The cost of invisible labor
- Quiet system feedback as your energy drops
- A crash when you can’t keep up — even though you’re still doing everything

Made with
HTML, CSS, JS, and too much real-life experience.
Fully responsive. No libraries. Just logic and loss.
